## Summary
I submitted this project to Getir as a Case Study they sent me after I applied to an iOS developer position they offered, and I've made this "to-do" application while carefully following all their requirements.

Also, I've added a few ideas and features that I thought it would be nice to have.
All the features are listed down below.

### Requirements:

* A task should consist of a title and details ✅
* Tasks' titles should be shown in a list ✅
* Tasks can be deleted in listing screen ✅
* To see the detail of a task, a user should be able to navigate to detail screen ✅
* A user should be able to save, delete and update a task in detail screen ✅
